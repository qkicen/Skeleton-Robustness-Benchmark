# Skeleton-Robustness-Benchmark(RobustBenchHAR)

RobustBenchHAR is a pytorch framework to boost and evaluate the adversarial transferability for Human skeletal behavior recognition. Official code for the paper:

> **ICLR2025 TASAR: Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition**

Key Features of RobustBenchHAR:
+ **A benchmark for evaluating existing transfer-based attacks in human Activity Recognition (HAR)**: RobustBenchHAR ensembles existing transfer-based attacks including several types and fairly evaluates various transfer-based attacks under the same setting.
+ **Evaluate the robustness of various models and datasets**: RobustBenchHAR provides a plug-and-play interface to verify the robustness of models on different data sets.
+ **A summary of transfer-based attacks and defenses**: RobustBenchHAR reviews numerous transfer-based attacks and adversarial defenses, making it easy to get the whole picture of transfer-based attacks for practitioners.

## Usage
**The complete code will be available soon.**
